# hlo
HLO: Half-kernel Laplacian Operator for Surface Smoothing

### Usage

To try our method for mesh denoising, you can directly run the 'HLO.exe' inside `demo.rar`.

```
upzip the demo.rar
 and copy noisy mesh into the demo folder (e.g., bunny.off, supported format: obj, off, stl, wrl, ply, mesh)
run: HLO.exe bunny.off 5
```


'bunny.off' is the input mesh, 5 is the number of vertex update iteration.
You will see the denoised mesh inside the same folder.
